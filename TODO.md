# Project TODO & Future Improvements

## High Priority Items

### üö® CRITICAL: Specialty System Refactoring
> **Status**: Pending WordPress Plugin Update  
> **Priority**: HIGH  
> **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks  

**Background**: The current specialty system relies on ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) for specialty data management. This needs to be refactored once the physician plugin is updated to use custom post types for specialties.

**Current Implementation**:
- Specialties stored as ACF fields on physician posts
- Limited specialty metadata capabilities
- Performance limitations with large datasets
- Complex specialty relationship management

**Target Implementation**:
- Custom post type for specialties (`specialty` post type)
- Native WordPress taxonomy for specialty categories
- Enhanced specialty metadata (descriptions, icons, etc.)
- Hierarchical specialty relationships (parent/child)
- Improved performance with native WordPress queries

**Required Changes**:

#### 1. WordPress Backend Changes
- [ ] Create custom post type for specialties
- [ ] Design specialty taxonomy structure  
- [ ] Create specialty metadata fields
- [ ] Build data migration script from ACF to custom post type
- [ ] Update WordPress admin interface for specialty management

#### 2. GraphQL Schema Updates
- [ ] Update WPGraphQL schema for new specialty post type
- [ ] Create new specialty resolvers
- [ ] Add specialty taxonomy queries
- [ ] Implement specialty metadata queries
- [ ] Add specialty hierarchy support

#### 3. Frontend Component Updates
- [ ] Update `queries/PhysicianQueries.js` for new specialty structure
- [ ] Refactor `components/specialtySearchUtils.js` for new data structure
- [ ] Update `components/specialtyAcronymMap.js` if needed
- [ ] Modify all specialty autocomplete components
- [ ] Update specialty-specific page queries in `wp-templates/single-specialty.js`
- [ ] Refactor specialty filters in `components/find-doc/search-filter-sidebar.js`

#### 4. URL & Routing Updates  
- [ ] Review specialty page URL structure
- [ ] Update Next.js routing for specialty pages
- [ ] Ensure SEO optimization for new specialty URLs
- [ ] Add redirects from old to new URLs if needed

#### 5. Testing & Migration
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for new specialty system
- [ ] Develop rollback plan in case of issues
- [ ] Plan gradual rollout strategy
- [ ] Document migration process
- [ ] Train content managers on new specialty management interface

**Dependencies**:
- WordPress physician plugin update
- WPGraphQL compatibility verification
- Content team training on new admin interface

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Maintain ACF fields during transition period
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Create comprehensive backup before migration
- Plan for rollback scenario
