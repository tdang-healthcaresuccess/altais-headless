# Filter Logic Update - COMPLETED ✅

## Issue - RESOLVED
The language, insurance, gender, and degree filters now use OR logic with array-based backend filtering.

**Updated Behavior (OR logic - IMPLEMENTED):**
- User selects: English, Spanish
- Results: Doctors who speak English OR Spanish (or both)

**Updated Behavior for All Filters:**
- **Languages**: Multiple selection - shows doctors speaking ANY selected language
- **Insurance**: Multiple selection - shows doctors accepting ANY selected insurance  
- **Gender**: Multiple selection - shows doctors of ANY selected gender
- **Degree**: Multiple selection - shows doctors with ANY selected degree

## Frontend Implementation ✅
The frontend components have been updated to support multiple selections:
- `search-filter-sidebar.js` sends arrays of selected values for all filters
- Parent components send arrays directly to GraphQL (no more comma-separated strings)
- All filters support multiple checkbox selections

## Backend GraphQL Schema ✅
Updated schema now uses arrays:
```graphql
language: [String]    # OR logic ✅  
insurance: [String]   # OR logic ✅
gender: [String]      # OR logic ✅
degree: [String]      # OR logic ✅
```

2. **search-filter-sidebar.js**:
